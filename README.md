# MMX-Unit
This project implements an arithmetic unit using MMX SIMD instructions in VHDL for FPGA-based processing. It supports six arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and saturated arithmetic). Designed for parallel computation on the Nexys A7 FPGA, optimizing performance for vectorized data processing.
